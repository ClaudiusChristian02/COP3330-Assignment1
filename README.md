COP3330-Assignment1
===================


This was the first object oriented program I created.

Via the command line this program asks the user to input a size, a shape,  what character the shape outline should use,
and what character the shape should be filled with. Moreover, there is a grow and shrink function where the user can grow
and shrink the object.
